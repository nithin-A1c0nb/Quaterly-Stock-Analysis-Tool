This tool is basically used to analyze stocks, it can be changes in quaterly stock screeneing or yearly

This updates the changes in the price and other field and give suggestion to user which field has done well and which field is doing poorly

I have added the ratio and variable hardcoded in execl so it read the top heading from excel and then it check for both the excel and give out which how each ratios are playing out

This is just a concept anyone who has more fine graded control can modify and use this as per thier requirement and other feature will be added in upcoming updates.

You would need two excel Ex: one previous quarter and one current quarter, I have used screener to get this details to excel using Power automate tool
